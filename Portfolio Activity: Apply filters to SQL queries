Portfolio Activity: Apply filters to SQL queries
+=========================+
Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. You recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.

Your task is to examine the organization’s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. You’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.

Note: This scenario involves the same queries as the ones the 
Filter with AND, OR, and NOT
lab. You can revisit the lab to get screenshots to include in your portfolio document. If you choose, it's also possible to complete this activity without revisiting the lab by typing your queries in the template.

+=========================+
Step 1: Access the template
+=========================+
Follow the instructions to complete each step of the activity. Then, answer the 8 questions at the end of the activity before going to the next course item to compare your work to a completed exemplar.

Step 1: Access the template
To use the template for this course item, click the following link and select Use Template. (In this step, you will just open the template. More instructions for how to use the template will be included in later steps.)

Note:  It is recommended that you use the Filter with AND, OR, and NOT lab to complete this portfolio activity. If you’re revisiting the lab, the Table formats document is optional. You will also be able to view the tables in the lab.

Step 3: Retrieve after hours failed login attempts
+=========================+
You recently discovered a potential security incident that occurred after business hours. To investigate this, you need to query the log_in_attempts table and review after hours login activity. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00. (The time of the login attempt is found in the login_time column. The success column contains a value of 0 when a login attempt failed; you can use either a value of 0 or FALSE in your query to identify failed login attempts.)

Describe your query and how it works in the Retrieve after hours failed login attempts section of the Apply filters to SQL queries template. 

In the Filter with AND, OR, and NOT lab, take a screenshot of the SQL query you used and copy it into the template. Or, type this query directly into the template.
+=========================+
Step 4: Retrieve login attempts on specific dates
+=========================+
A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. To investigate this event, you want to review all login attempts which occurred on this day and the day before. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all login attempts that occurred on 2022-05-09 or 2022-05-08. (The date of the login attempt is found in the login_date column.)

Describe your query and how it works in the Retrieve login attempts on specific dates section of the Apply filters to SQL queries template. 

In the Filter with AND, OR, and NOT lab, take a screenshot of the SQL query you used and copy it into the template. Or, type this query directly into the template.
+=========================+
Step 5: Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico
+=========================+
There’s been suspicious activity with login attempts, but the team has determined that this activity didn't originate in Mexico. Now, you need to investigate login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. (When referring to Mexico, the country column contains values of both MEX and MEXICO, and you need to use the LIKE keyword with % to make sure your query reflects this.)

Describe your query and how it works in the Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico section of the Apply filters to SQL queries template. 

In the Filter with AND, OR, and NOT lab, take a screenshot of the SQL query you used and copy it into the template. Or, type this query directly into the template.
+=========================+
Step 6: Retrieve employees in Marketing
+=========================+
Your team wants to perform security updates on specific employee machines in the Marketing department. You’re responsible for getting information on these employee machines and will need to query the employees table. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all employees in the Marketing department for all offices in the East building.

(The department of the employee is found in the department column, which contains values that include Marketing. The office is found in the office column. Some examples of values in this column are East-170, East-320, and North-434. You’ll need to use the LIKE keyword with % to filter for the East building.)

Describe your query and how it works in the Retrieve employees in Marketing section of the Apply filters to SQL queries template. 

In the Filter with AND, OR, and NOT lab, take a screenshot of the SQL query you used and copy it into the template. Or, type this query directly into the template.
+=========================+
Step 7: Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales
+=========================+
Your team now needs to perform a different security update on machines for employees in the Sales and Finance departments. Use filters in SQL to create a query that identifies all employees in the Sales or Finance departments. (The department of the employee is found in the department column, which contains values that include Sales and Finance.)

Describe your query and how it works in the Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales section of the Apply filters to SQL queries template. 

In the Filter with AND, OR, and NOT lab, take a screenshot of the SQL query you used and copy it into the template. Or, type this query directly into the template.
+=========================+
Step 8: Retrieve all employees not in IT
+=========================+
Your team needs to make one more update to employee machines. The employees who are in the Information Technology department already had this update, but employees in all other departments need it. Use filters in SQL to create a query which identifies all employees not in the IT department. (The department of the employee is found in the department column, which contains values that include Information Technology.)

Describe your query and how it works in the Retrieve all employees not in IT section of the Apply filters to SQL queries template. 

In the Filter with AND, OR, and NOT lab, take a screenshot of the SQL query you used and copy it into the template. Or, type this query directly into the template.
